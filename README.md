# Data Analysis with R Programming

Welcome to my repository for the **Data Analysis with R Programming** course, part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. This repository contains a collection of R scripts developed during the hands-on activities in the course. The focus of these scripts is to perform data analysis, manipulation, and visualization tasks using R, specifically working with datasets such as penguins and hotel bookings.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to showcase my ability to apply fundamental data analysis techniques using R. Through these scripts, I have demonstrated key skills such as data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization. Each script is designed to solve a specific problem or exercise from the course, and all scripts are thoroughly commented to explain the thought process behind the code.

### Key Techniques Covered:
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Using R packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr` to clean and restructure datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights into the data by visualizing and summarizing key features.
- **Data Visualization**: Crafting clear, insightful visualizations using `ggplot2` to convey patterns and trends in the data.
- **Working with Real-World Datasets**: Analyzing datasets like penguins and hotel bookings, simulating tasks often faced by data analysts in professional settings.

## Project Files

This repository is organized into the following main folder:

### `HandsOnActivity/`

The `HandsOnActivity` folder contains **15 R scripts** that demonstrate a range of data analysis tasks. The scripts are well-commented, and each one is a self-contained exercise designed to showcase specific techniques or concepts. 

Here are some examples of the scripts included in this folder:
- **hoa_1.R**: Introduction to basic data structures in R, including vectors, lists, and data frames.
- **hoa_10_1_aestheticsAndFacets.R**: Visualizing data with aesthetics and facets using the `ggplot2` package.
- **hoa_4_hotelBooking.R**: Analyzing hotel booking data to explore trends and patterns using various R functions.
- **hoa_3_1_penguins.R**: Analyzing the penguin dataset and performing basic statistical analysis to uncover insights.
- **hoa_9_dataVisualizationUsingGgplot.R**: A comprehensive guide to creating advanced visualizations in R using `ggplot2`.

## Skills Demonstrated

Throughout this repository, I demonstrate my understanding of key data analysis concepts, including:
- **R Programming**: Writing efficient and clear R code to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data.
- **Data Wrangling**: Using `dplyr` and `tidyr` for cleaning and reshaping data, making it ready for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Leveraging `ggplot2` to create meaningful visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing data exploration to uncover trends, patterns, and potential outliers.

## How to Use

To begin using the scripts, you can either download or clone this repository to your local machine. Each script is designed to be run in **RStudio**. Once you open a script in RStudio, you can run the code line by line to observe the results and explore the comments for an in-depth explanation of the logic behind the analysis.

## Future Work

This repository will continue to evolve as I build on my learning and complete more advanced data analysis projects. In the future, I plan to add more complex projects that incorporate additional data analysis techniques, including machine learning models and larger datasets.
